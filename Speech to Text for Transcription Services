# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates how to use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert spoken language into text, facilitating transcription services using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this notebook is to convert audio recordings into transcribed text using pretrained models. This can be useful for creating subtitles, voice commands, call center documentation, or accessibility services.

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

* `transformers` by Hugging Face
* `torchaudio`
* `librosa` for audio preprocessing
* `IPython.display` for audio playback
* Pretrained model: **`openai/whisper`** (or another Whisper-based model, depending on usage)

## 🚀 Key Features

* Load and preprocess `.wav` audio files
* Use a pretrained ASR model for transcription
* Display transcribed text
* (Optional) Include audio playback for interactive Jupyter use

## 📁 Project Structure

The notebook follows this structure:

1. **Setup and Installation** – Install required libraries.
2. **Audio Preprocessing** – Load and prepare audio for the model.
3. **Model Loading** – Load Whisper or similar ASR model.
4. **Transcription** – Run the model and extract text from audio.
5. **Results Display** – Show transcribed output and optionally play back audio.

## 🗂️ Input

* Accepts audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`, etc.), with preference for `.wav` for consistent processing.

## 📤 Output

* Transcribed plain text from audio.

## 📝 Usage

1. Upload an audio file.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
3. Get the transcribed text output.

## ✅ Requirements

Install these packages if not already available:

```bash
pip install torchaudio transformers librosa
```

## 💡 Notes

* This notebook uses pretrained models and does not require training from scratch.
* Performance and accuracy may vary depending on the quality and length of the audio.
